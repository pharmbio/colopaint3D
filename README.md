## Analysis pipelines for Cell Painting in 3D spheroids

This repository contains supporting scripts and files used in the analysis for the paper: 
"High-content morphological profiling by Cell Painting in 3D  spheroids".

In the paper, we propose a scalable method to apply Cell Painting in 3D, 
enabling single-cell morphological profiling in more physiologically relevant models.
We observed that the profiles have a decent correlation between replicates, and that we can find clusters of drugs with a similar biology. 
By sharing this approach, we hope to inspire the communinity to extend 
its vast expertise to 3D cell models.
 

### Downloading data
More on this will follow. 
We aim to make the images, cell pose models, and feature files available in a suitable repository.

### Usage
TODO: 
* Image of the analysis pipeline

Here is a short summary: 
* Features are preprocessed in FeatureSorting and pycytominer
* Aggregated morphological profiles are then used for plotting the figures of the paper.
