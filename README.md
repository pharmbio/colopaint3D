## Analysis pipelines for Cell Painting in 3D spheroids

This repository contains supporting scripts and codes used in the analysis for the paper: 
"High-content morphological profiling by Cell Painting in 3D spheroids".

### Summary

Cell Painting is a popular assay for morphological profiling of 2D monolayer cell cultures.  
In the paper, we propose a scalable method to apply Cell Painting in 3D. 
The workflow is largely based on existing analysis strategies, 
with some adaptations to enable single-cell morphological profiling of 3D spheroids.

This repository contains a collection of notebooks for processing CellProfiler features of 3D spheroids 
and creating figures that accompany the manuscript. 

### Downloading data
More on this will follow. 
We aim to make the images, cell pose models, and feature files available in a suitable repository.
